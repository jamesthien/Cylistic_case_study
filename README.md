# Case Study Introduction
## Scenario

In this case study, I will be using the open source data of NewYork citibike to complete a case study.

In this Scenario, I am a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago.

**Cyclistic** is a fictional company. For the purposes of this case study, the datasets are appropriate and will enable me to answer the business questions. The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this [license](https://www.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).

## Characters and teams
● Cyclistic: A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart
by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities
and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use
the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each
day.
● Lily Moreno: The director of marketing and your manager. Moreno is responsible for the development of campaigns and
initiatives to promote the bike-share program. These may include email, social media, and other channels.
● Cyclistic marketing analytics team: A team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting
data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy. You joined this team six months ago and have been busy learning about
Cyclistic’s mission and business goals — as well as how you, as a junior data analyst, can help Cyclistic achieve them.
● Cyclistic executive team: The notoriously detail-oriented executive team will decide whether to approve the
recommended marketing program.
