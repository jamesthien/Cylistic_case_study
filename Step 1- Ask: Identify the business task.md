## Ask
Three questions will guide the future marketing program:
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

Moreno (director of marketing) has assigned me the first question to answer: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

I will produce a report with the following deliverables:
1. **Ask**: A clear statement of the business task
2. **Prepare**: A description of all data sources used
3. **Process**: Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data
4. **Analyze**: A summary of my analysis
5. **Share**: Supporting visualizations and key findings 
6. **Act**: Top three recommendations based on my analysis

## My process

- The problem I am trying to solve is that define the difference use of annual members and casual riders using Cyclistic bikes

- My insights can help the director of marketing better informed of the difference of two types of riders to decide a suitable marketing program to boost annual membership total number.
