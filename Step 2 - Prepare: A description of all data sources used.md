First, I download the data from the website <https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html>, using only the first 3 months of the year 2023 to analyze as the first quarter of the year. For the purpose of the case study, I would like to size down to a quarter instead of a full year (although I should concerned that bike riders demand and use may vary at different time in the year).

I downloaded and store the data in my personal computer that has password so that I can keep the data secure.

All 3 files of the data were originally CSV (Comma-separated values) files.

All three files contain a total of more than 600,000 records. After briefly inspect the data, I have noticed some NULL values (no data) as well as inconsistent data in a few columns. 


I will load this data in to Microsoft Excel Workbook to prepare to filter and clean in the next step.

But before doing so, I will make a copy of the data to go back and reuse if I needed to:
